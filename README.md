Funny little app to torture streamers. Viewers donate, streamer go blind.

# THIS APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
Literally no point in downloading the source code other than seeing my faliures.

This app requires a streamlabs SocketAPI token (**NOT TO BE MISTAKEN AS THE `access_token`**). Some of you may be concerned as to what this app can do to your streamlabs account through this token and you're correct for doing so. This token only gives me access to read certain "events" that happen to your streamlabs account (Such as donations or subscriptions). If you want to know more about what data this app will take, look [here](https://dev.streamlabs.com/docs/socket-api). I also spoke directly to the streamlabs API support team and they reinforce my answer here:
