# Twitch flashbang
*Funny little app to torture streamers. Viewers donate, streamer go blind.*

Made by me because I was bored and this sounded funny.

# Usage
Let me finish for christ sake.

# THIS APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
Literally no point in downloading the source code other than seeing my faliures.

# Privacy and security
This app requires a streamlabs SocketAPI token (**NOT TO BE MISTAKEN AS THE `access_token`**). Some of you may be concerned as to what this app can do to your streamlabs account through this token and you're correct for doing so. This token only gives me access to read certain "events" that happen to your streamlabs account (Such as donations or subscriptions). If you want to know more about what data this app will take, look [here](https://dev.streamlabs.com/docs/socket-api). I also spoke directly to the streamlabs API support team and they reinforce my answer here:

# Issues, Bug reports and suggestions

They will be reviewed, answered or resolved if they can. Please also provide evidence or examples to any issue or problem you may be having as it makes it infinitely easier to find and fix the issue.

> ### Please avoid posting known issues as they probably will be closed on post. Here are a list of known issues:
> * The flashbang overlay doesn't properly fit the screen
> * The app locked at 60 FPS.
>   - There might be an option to change this later but as of know, the flashbang effect is dependent on the framerate of the overlay. This is how the overlay works and I can't really do much about it **(Note: If the Win32 version is developed, this may not be a limitation)**. If you're streaming 
or recording, 60 FPS should already be fine for your viewers as usually videos and streams aren't recorded at more than 60 FPS. If you're using a 60hz monitor, the flashbang effect may look a little choppy but otherwise, its still fine.
